main.py is the simulation script. Nothing special needs to be done to run this, just modify settings according to the document if desired.

test_illustrate.py isn't strictly necessary to run yourselves, but it does contain arrays of all of my data in an easily-read format.
Also, it contains the Shapiro-Wilk test and histogram printing that I did.
